I’m a student at [Marist College](http://marist.edu) pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus on software development, with minors in graphic design, information systems, and information technology.

I’m also a web developer that works primarily with Ruby, JavaScript, and occasionally Haskell. I’ve been working in the web field for six years, and I'm currently an intern at [Oak](http://oak.is). I work on [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com), its documentation site [Siteleaf Learn](http://learn.siteleaf.com), and our client site [Working Not Working](http://workingnotworking.com). Previously, I was the Chief Information Officer for the [Marist College Student Government Association](http://sga.marist.edu) and a web developer at [Fanzter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzter).
